# SocialOpenSenseMap
Our group has two major areas to develop: threshold and notification center.

## Threshold
For the threshold, users can set a value after following the sensor.  When a measured value transpasses the threshold, the user is notified.

## Notification center
All notifications the user has appears at the notification center: threshold, unusual measurement, broken sensors.
